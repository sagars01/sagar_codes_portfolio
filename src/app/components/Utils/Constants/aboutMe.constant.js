Oh, and he partied some more."

He also delivered an e-commerce MVP for TSV (USA) using Angular and Salesforce APEX, becoming a guru in Angular and JS. Tough life!!"

Eventually, he was tasked with building a Loyalty Platform along with many other retail tech industry experts. Along with the team, he built it, scaled it, and his leadership went gaga. They promoted him to Lead Software Engineer, and he started leading a team of 5. He learned about architecture at scale, microservices, CDNs, and other fancy stuff that other engineers flaunt to show their knowledge. But life is unfair, isn't it? He eventually grew bored of that role and wanted more money and thrill. He wanted to join consulting again for the \"thrill\", because product development is boring. You build a product, then wait for it to scale, then create problems in your head about issues, fix them for a long time, and then pursue another idea if time and budget permit. So he needed a fast life. The next job was his bet."
